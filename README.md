# Curbing Crowd Size
The World Health Organization, WHO, has advised people to stay away from crowded places to protect themselves from the spread of Coronavirus disease. Even though people practice social distancing, it may not be effective when they are present in crowded places.

<h4> Hence, we developed an application using  Arduino Uno and added resources that counts the number of people in a given area and controls the crowd. </h4>
